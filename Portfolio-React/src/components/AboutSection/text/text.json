  "description": "I am a Web developer with a bunch of various skills from my previous jobs, coding courses and of course my last journey in Sourcery Academy for Frontend developers. I get excited about opportunities where I get to turn the design into a working website. Which I think is one of the most important things to have. Not only for companies but also for any individual person in today's economy."
